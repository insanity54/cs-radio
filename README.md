cs-radio
===========

For use in Airsoft games when automated transmission of audio files over FRS radios is desired.

Allows two radios to be connected to one stereo output, using the left channel for radio 1, and right channel for radio 2. This allows one radio per team, ex: Radio 1 set to FRS channel 3, Radio 2 set to FRS channel 11.

The program also provides a method for externally triggering the Push-To-Talk button of each FRS radio.

Designed for use with Raspberry Pi.
